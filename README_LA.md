## Abstract

This dissertation introduces **Resonance-Evaluated Computing** as a foundational element within the 
Resonance Data and Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing (QIRC) framework. 

Resonance-Evaluated Computing represents a novel conceptual contribution to the field of 
meaning-first artificial intelligence, where:

- **Meaning** is modeled as resonant state, not static point
- **Relevance** emerges from resonance strength, not distance
- **Memory** persists through repeated coherence over time
- **Decision** is modeled as resonance collapse, not ranking

---

## 1. Introduction

Modern AI systems excel at processing information but fail to preserve 
**insight** or **wisdom** over time. Current paradigms rely on:

- Similarity measures in vector space
- Ranking-based decisions
- Static or purely accumulative memory

Resonance-Evaluated Computing addresses this gap by introducing a resonance-based framework
that captures temporal coherence and meaning persistence.

## 2. Definition of Resonance-Evaluated Computing

Resonance-Evaluated Computing is defined as:

> A conceptual framework within the Vega Continuum that describes 
> [specific function/property] through resonance-based modeling.

### 2.1 What This IS

- A conceptual, non-operational framework
- A mathematical metaphor inspired by quantum mechanics
- A meaning-first approach to information processing
- A contribution to prior art without implementation disclosure

### 2.2 What This IS NOT

- NOT new physics
- NOT quantum hardware
- NOT a claim of consciousness or sentience
- NOT an algorithm or code specification
- NOT system architecture or implementation

## 3. Relationship to Core Concepts

### 3.1 Resonance Data

Resonance-Evaluated Computing builds upon Resonance Data by extending the notion of 
meaning as relationship rather than distance.

### 3.2 QIRC

Within Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing, Resonance-Evaluated Computing contributes 
to the understanding of superimposed meaning states and their collapse.

### 3.3 Vega Continuum

Resonance-Evaluated Computing is situated within the Vega Continuum as a temporal 
coherence mechanism for meaning persistence.

## 4. Mathematical Framework (Conceptual)

Let R represent a resonance state, where:

- R(t) describes resonance at time t
- ||R|| denotes resonance strength
- R* represents collapsed (decided) state

The evolution of Resonance-Evaluated Computing follows:

dR/dt = f(R, context, time)

This is a conceptual, not computational, formulation.

## 5. Applications (Conceptual)

Resonance-Evaluated Computing may conceptually inform:

- Multi-level reasoning systems
- Temporal coherence mechanisms
- Meaning-first AI architectures
- Knowledge persistence frameworks

No implementation details are disclosed per VSP.
